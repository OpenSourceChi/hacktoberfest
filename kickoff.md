## Contributing review

## How to find work

![](images/toilet_computer.jpg)

## Write down bugs

Investigate bugs in the software you use every day and fix them.

## Software crush

Look at software you think is cool and want to understand.  Study it, issues will come up.

## Ask the maintainer

If the project is small, check with the maintainer if they want help on any particular issue

# Etiquette

## Be polite

You can build a reputation as being easy to work with 

## Defer to maintainers

We submit individual changes but maintainers have to integrate work across the project

## Avoid spamming

* Fine most of the time: Whitespace + deeply buried spelling mistakes
* Avoid during Hacktoberfest

## Rebase your work as needed
## Your opinions?
